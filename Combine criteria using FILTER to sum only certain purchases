1. create a measure called Sales, which should sum the price multiplied by the quantity.
Sales = SUMX(Purchase,[Quantity] * [Price])

2. create a new measure called Sales in 2018
Sales2018 = SUMX(
                FILTER(Purchase,
                        YEAR(Purchase[PurchaseDate]) == 2018),
                [Quantity] * [Price])

3. create a new measure called Big sales 2018, which only sums sales where:
  The purchase year is 2018; and
  The quantity of goods bought for a purchase was 5 or more.
BIGSales2018 = SUMX(
                FILTER(Purchase,
                        AND(Purchase[Quantity] >= 5,
                        YEAR(Purchase[PurchaseDate]) == 2018)),
                [Quantity] * [Price])
