Use conditional functions like IF and SWITCH to add calculated columns to a Power BI data model of tallest buildings..


1.Create a calculated column called Has basement which tests if the value of the Floors below ground column equals 0. If so, the formula should return No, otherwise it should return Yes. 
Has Basement = 
                If(
                    Building[Floors below ground] > 0,
                    "True",
                    "False"
                )

2.Create a calculated column called Century which uses an IF function to show the century in which the building was opened. A building which opened before the year 2001 belongs to the 20th Century , otherwise it belongs to the 21st Century.
Century = 
        IF(
            Building[Year opened] < 2001,
            "20th Century",
            "21st Century"
        )

3.Create a calculated column called Size which uses the SWITCH function to assign each building to a category according to the following table:

Height m                 Category
Less than 400             Tiny
400 to less than 500      Small
500 to less than 600      Medium
600 to less than 700      Big
700 or more               Massive

Category = 
            SWITCH(
                TRUE(),
                Building[Height m] < 400 , "Tiny",
                Building[Height m] >= 400 && Building[Height m] < 500 , "Small",
                Building[Height m] >= 500 && Building[Height m] < 600 , "Medium",
                Building[Height m] >= 600 && Building[Height m] < 700 , "Big",
                 Building[Height m] >= 700 , "Massive"
            )


4. Create a calculated column called Location which tests if the Coordinates column is blank. If so, the formula should return Unknown location, otherwise it should return the value of the Coordinates column.
Location = 
            IF(
                Building[Coordinates] == BLANK(),
                "Unknown Location",
                Building[Coordinates]
            )
