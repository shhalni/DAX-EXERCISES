avg Height vs Avg Height of Selected Country = 

[Avg Height] - 
CALCULATE(
     [Avg Height],
     Country[Country] = SELECTEDVALUE(CountryPicker[Country Name])
)


Create a measure which concatenates the phrase Average building height vs with the name of the selected country.
Country Title = "Average building height vs " & SELECTEDVALUE(CountryPicker[Country Name])
