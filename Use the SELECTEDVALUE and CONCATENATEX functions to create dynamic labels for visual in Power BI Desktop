Use the SELECTEDVALUE and CONCATENATEX functions to create dynamic labels for visual in Power BI Desktop

a. Create a dynamic label for buildings according to the slicer selection 

Country label = 
if(
    not(ISBLANK(SELECTEDVALUE(Country[Country]))),
   "Tallest building in " & SELECTEDVALUE(Country[Country],  "Multiple Countries") & " (" & [Count of Buildings] &" buildings)",
    "Tallest building among all countries"
)

b.  Create a meausure with lists the building names, separating each with a new line. Assign this measure to the tooltips of the chart.
List of Buildings = CONCATENATEX(
    Building,
    Building[Building Name] & " (" & Building[Height m] & "m)",
    UNICHAR(10),
    Building[Height m], DESC,
    Building[Building Name], ASC
)
