Link a staff table to a calendar table twice, then use USERELATIONSHIP

Create 2 measures - 
a. Number of joiners	Use the relationship to the DateJoined field to count how many staff members joined in a given time period.
No. born = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS(Staff),
        USERELATIONSHIP(Dates[DateKey],Staff[DateBorn])
    )

b. Number born	Use the relationship to the DateBorn field to count how many staff members were born in a given time period.
No. joined = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS(Staff),
        USERELATIONSHIP(Dates[DateKey],Staff[DateJoined])
    ) 

or 

 No. joined = COUNTROWS(Staff)
