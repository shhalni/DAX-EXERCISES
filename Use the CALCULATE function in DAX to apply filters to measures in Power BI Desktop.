a. % shows in demolished venues
% shows in demolished venues = DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(
        [Count shows],

    [Count shows]
)

b. % shows in closed undemolished venues
% shows in closed undemolished venues = DIVIDE(

    ),
    [Count shows]
)

c. % shows in open venues
% shows in open venues = DIVIDE(

    [Count shows]
)

d. % cancelled shows
% cancelled shows = DIVIDE(

e. % of all shows cancelled due to covid

    ),
    [Count shows]
)

f. % of cancelled shows cancelled due to covid
% of cancelled shows cancelled due to COVID = DIVIDE(

)

j. % unsold tickets
% unsold tickets = CALCULATE(
    DIVIDE(
