Use Power BI's automatic calendar tables and time intelligence functions in DAX measures.

a.Add a measure to create a monthly running total of tickets sold using the TOTALMTD function.
Monthly Running Total Tickets Sold = IF(
    NOT(ISBLANK([Tickets Sold])),
    TOTALMTD([Tickets Sold], Show[Show date].[Date])
)

b.Create a measure which compares the sum of single length with the same period in the previous year. 
Sum Single Length vs. Same Dates Last Year = [Sum Single Length (secs)] - 
CALCULATE(
    [Sum Single Length (secs)],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Track[Single release date].[Date])
)

c.Add a measure which compares the sum of single length with the same value from one month ago.
Sum Single Length vs. Previous Month = IF(
    ISINSCOPE(Track[Single release date].[Month]),
    [Sum Single Length (secs)] - 
    CALCULATE(
        [Sum Single Length (secs)],
        DATEADD(Track[Single release date].[Date], -1, MONTH)
    )
)
