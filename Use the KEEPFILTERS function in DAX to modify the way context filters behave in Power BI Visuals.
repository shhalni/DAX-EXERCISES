Use the KEEPFILTERS function in DAX to modify the way context filters behave in Power BI Visuals.

1. Create a measure which shows the average peak chart position for any three artists of your choice. Replace the current measure in the chart with your new measure.
Avg peak chart position selected artists = CALCULATE(
    [Avg peak chart position],
    KEEPFILTERS(
        Artist[Artist] IN {"AC/DC", "Cher", "U2"}
    )
)

2. Create another measure which shows the average peak chart position and which excludes any three artists of your choice. 
Avg peak chart position exclude selected artists = CALCULATE(
    [Avg peak chart position],
    KEEPFILTERS(
        NOT Artist[Artist] IN {"Celine Dion", "One Direction", "Spice Girls"}
    )
)

3. Create three measures to show these values and place them in the line chart 
          Pre-COVID       Up to and including 2020 .
          During COVID    2020 to 2022 inclusive.
          Post-COVID      2022 or later.

a. % cancelled shows pre COVID = CALCULATE(
    [% cancelled shows],
    KEEPFILTERS(Show[Show date].[Year] <= 2019)
)

b. % cancelled shows COVID = CALCULATE(
    [% cancelled shows],
    KEEPFILTERS(
        Show[Show date].[Year] >= 2020 &&
        Show[Show date].[Year] <= 2022
    )
)

c. % cancelled shows post COVID = CALCULATE(
    [% cancelled shows],
    KEEPFILTERS(Show[Show date].[Year] > 2022)
)
