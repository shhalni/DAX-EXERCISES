Use the FILTER function in a DAX measure to provide a filtered version of a table to other functions.

1. Create a measure which uses the SUMX and FILTER functions to calculate the total tickets sold for sold-out shows only. You can compare the Tickets available and Tickets sold columns to determine if a show was sold out.
Sold out shows only = 
                        SUMX(
                            FILTER(
                                Show,
                                [Tickets Sold] == Show[Tickets available]
                            ),
                            [Tickets Sold]
                        )

2. Create two measures using the FILTER function to do the following:
  a. Count shows which were cancelled.
      Cancelled Shows = 
                    COUNTROWS(
                        FILTER(Show,
                                Show[Cancelled] = 1)
                    )

  b. Count shows which were cancelled and which mention COVID as a reason. You can use the CONTAINSSTRING function to test this.
      COVID Cancelled Shows = 
                        SUMX(
                            Filter(
                                Show,
                                CONTAINSSTRING(Show[Cancellation reason],"COVID")
                            ),
                            Show[Cancelled]
                        )

3. Add a measure which counts the shows where the country is Spain or the venue type is a Bullring. Use the FILTER and RELATED functions to do this.
    Shows in Spain or Bullring = 
                        COUNTROWS(
                            Filter(
                                Show,
                                Or(
                                    CONTAINSSTRING(RELATED(Country[Country]) , "Spain"),
                                    CONTAINSSTRING(RELATED('Venue Type'[Venue type]) , "Bullring")
                                )
                            )
                        )
