Use the ALLEXCEPT function to remove multiple filters in a DAX measure in Power BI Desktop.

Create a measure which uses a combination of the DIVIDE, CALCULATE and ALLEXCEPT functions to calculate the count of shows as a percentage of the year total.
Count Shows % of year (ALLEXCEPT)= 
                                DIVIDE(
                                    [Count Shows],
                                    CALCULATE(
                                            [Count Shows],
                                            ALLEXCEPT(Show,
                                                      Show[Show date].[Year]
                                            )
                                    )
                                )


                    or

Count Shows % of year (ALL) = 
                                DIVIDE(
                                    [Count Shows],
                                    CALCULATE(
                                            [Count Shows],
                                            ALL(Show[Show date].[Month],
                                            Show[Show date].[MonthNo],
                                            Show[Show date].[QuarterNo],
                                            Show[Show date].[Quarter]
                                                
                                            )
                                    )
                                )
