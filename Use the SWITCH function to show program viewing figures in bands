Use the SWITCH function to show program viewing figures in bands

create a new column called Viewing Band which uses the SWITCH function to allocate series to different bands according to these rules:

Million viewers        	Band
Up to and including 5	  Niche
6 to 8	                Mainstream
9 to 12	                Cult
More than 12	          National treasure

Viewing Band = 
Switch(
    True(),
    Series[Viewers (m)]<=5 , "Niche",
    Series[Viewers (m)] >=6 && Series[Viewers (m)] <=8, "Mainstream",
     Series[Viewers (m)] >=9 && Series[Viewers (m)] <=12, "Cult",
       Series[Viewers (m)] >12 , "National Treasure"
)
