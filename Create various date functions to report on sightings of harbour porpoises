Create various date functions to report on sightings of harbour porpoises


1. create a measure called Previous month to show sightings for the previous month:

Previous month = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Whales with porpoises'[No]),
    PREVIOUSMONTH('Calendar'[DateKey])
)


2. create a measure called Two months ago which shows sightings two months previously:

Two months ago = 
    CALCULATE(
        sum('Whales with porpoises'[No]),
        DATEADD(
            'Calendar'[DateKey],
            -2,
            MONTH
        )
    )
