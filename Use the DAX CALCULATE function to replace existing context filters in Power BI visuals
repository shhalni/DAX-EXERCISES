Use the DAX CALCULATE function to replace existing context filters in Power BI visuals

1.Create a measure to compare the average track length in seconds with the same value where the subgenre equals pop. 
avg track length vs pop = 
 [avg track lenght] -
CALCULATE(
    [avg track lenght],
    Subgenre[Subgenre] = "pop"
    )

1. Avg track length vs. pop or rock
 Tracks whose subgenre is either pop or rock.
avg track length vs pop or rock = 
 [avg track lenght] -
CALCULATE(
    [avg track lenght],
    Subgenre[Subgenre] = "pop" || Subgenre[Subgenre] = "rock"
    )

3. Avg track length vs. all pop or rock
avg track length for all pop or rock = 
[avg track lenght] -
CALCULATE(
        [avg track lenght],
        CONTAINSSTRING(Subgenre[Subgenre],"pop") || CONTAINSSTRING(Subgenre[Subgenre],"rock")
)

4.
Create a measure to calculate the percentage of cancelled shows when the Show[Show date].[Year] is either 2020 or 2021 and another measure to calculate the same value excluding these years.
% cancelled shows COVID = 
    CALCULATE(
        [% cancelled shows],
        Filter(
            All(Show[Show date].[Year]),
             Show[Show date].[Year] in {2020,2021}
        )
    )

% cancelled shows NOn-COVID = 
    CALCULATE(
        [% cancelled shows],
        Filter(
            All(Show[Show date].[Year]),
             Show[Show date].[Year] <> 2020  && Show[Show date].[Year] <> 2021
        )
    )
