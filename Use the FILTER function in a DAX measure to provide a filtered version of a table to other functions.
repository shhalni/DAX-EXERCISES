Create a  measure which calculates the average number of floors for buildings which opened before the year 2010. Use a combination of the AVERAGEX and FILTER functions to do this.
Avg Total Floors before 2010 = 
                            AVERAGEX(
                                FILTER( 
                                    Building,
                                    Building[Year Opened] < 2010
                                ),
                                Building[Floors above ground] + Building[Floors below ground]
                         )

Create a measure using the AVERAGEX and FILTER functions which calculates the average number of floors for buildings which opened since the year 2010.
Avg Total Floors since 2010 = 
                            AVERAGEX(
                                FILTER( 
                                    Building,
                                    Building[Year Opened] >= 2010
                                ),
                                Building[Floors above ground] + Building[Floors below ground]
                         )
