Use COUNTROWS and RELATEDTABLE to count the rows in different tables

a. Number of regions	The number of regions in the related regions table.
Number of towns = 
    COUNTROWS(
        RELATEDTABLE(Regions)
    )

b. Number of towns	The number of towns in the related towns table.
Number of towns = 
    COUNTROWS(
        RELATEDTABLE(Towns)
    )

c. Number of Towns per region
Town per region = 
            DIVIDE(
                Quadrants[Number of towns],
                Quadrants[Number of region]
            )
