Work out how many breaks you'll need for each film using EARLIER

NumberBreaks earlier = 

        CALCULATE(
           VALUES(ComfortBreaks[Breaks]),
           Filter(
             Values(ComfortBreaks),
             ComfortBreaks[LowerLimit] <= EARLIER(Films[RunTimeMinutes])
             &&
             ComfortBreaks[UpperLimit] > EARLIER(Films[RunTimeMinutes])
           )

)  


NumberBreaks = 
        CALCULATE(
           VALUES(ComfortBreaks[Breaks]),
           Filter(
             Values(ComfortBreaks),
             ComfortBreaks[LowerLimit] <= (Films[RunTimeMinutes])
             &&
             ComfortBreaks[UpperLimit] > (Films[RunTimeMinutes])
           )

) ---Works only with cc even when earlier is not used
